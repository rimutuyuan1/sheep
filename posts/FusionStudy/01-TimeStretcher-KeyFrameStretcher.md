My name is **Ma Xiaoyang**

You can call me Sean.  My undergraduate major is photography and film.

My portfolio includes both conventional photography and installation photography. I have a penchant for delving into contemporary art through the use of installations, distinct lenses, and traditional narrative techniques in photography. 

In my view, photography is a sensory experience, a means for me to convey emotions. Through this medium, I can articulate thoughts and emotions that are challenging to verbalize. Studying photographers such as Becher and Alec Soth has provided me with a profound understanding of my craft. 

This depth of comprehension allows me to more comprehensively express my ideas in subsequent works, further shaping my perspective on photography and photographic installations. 

This is my view on photography and contemporary art, and I will continue to combine traditional photography and contemporary art in my way.
